# Other-Licenses
- The purpose of NBMax-top/Others-Licenses is to "include licenses that are not included in OSI, although these licenses are not rigorous"
- NBMax-top/Others-Licenses的宗旨是“收录OSI没有收录的License，尽管这些License不严谨”

## Inclusion principles:
1. It can be lax, but not too lax or with loopholes that can be seen by normal people
2. Only open source licenses are included
3. No substantive content is included
4. Some licenses can break certain rules and be included, but will be placed in the "Other" category (for example: UCOS License)
5. Licenses included by OSI are not included
6. No more

## 收录原则：
1. 可以不严谨，但不能严重的不严谨或正常人都能看出的漏洞
2. 只收录开源许可证
3. 无实质内容的不收录
4. 某些许可证可打破某些规则并收录，但会放入“Other”分类（比如：UCOS License）
5. 不收录OSI收录的许可证
6. 没了
